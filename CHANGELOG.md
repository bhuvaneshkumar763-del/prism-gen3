# prism-gen3

## 0.3.0-beta.4

### Minor Changes

- The options page is now a 5-tab layout (General, Page translation, Bubble, Selection & hover, Advanced) restored toward the pre-rewrite fork's depth — no Voice or Dictionary tab, since those engine subsystems don't exist in Gen 3. Adds theme selection, backup export/import, restore-defaults, per-site bubble and source-language override tables, and a translation-cache toggle that actually skips both the cache read and write when off. Also fixes a real fork inconsistency: adding a site to "always translate" now correctly removes it from "never translate" on the options page too, not just the popup. Final phase of the three-phase pass (bubble, popup, settings) restoring UI depth the ground-up rewrite had scoped down.

## 0.3.0-beta.3

### Minor Changes

- The toolbar popup gained the pre-rewrite fork's per-site/per-language quick actions — always/never translate this site, always translate from the detected language, and a per-site floating-bubble toggle — plus a "More settings" section for the hover-tooltip and selection-popup toggles (both previously hardcoded on with no config at all). Also closes a real gap: a translate that later fails is now surfaced in the popup itself, not just the bubble. Second of the three-phase pass (bubble, popup, settings) restoring UI depth the ground-up rewrite had scoped down.

## 0.3.0-beta.2

### Minor Changes

- The floating translate bubble is now always visible on every page (not just after translating), draggable with edge-docking and a remembered position, and its hover panel gained From/To/Service pickers plus Always/Settings/Hide actions — full parity with the pre-rewrite fork's bubble, reported as a real regression by a user comparing the two. Kept the "Translation failed" state this repo added post-launch. First of a three-phase pass (bubble, then popup, then settings) restoring UI depth the ground-up rewrite had scoped down.

## 0.2.2-beta.1

### Patch Changes

- Fix two real bugs reported by a user testing the beta: translation never worked out of the box because the shipped default provider (libretranslate.com, unauthenticated) is rate-limited to the point of being unusable — the default is now 'google' (free, no signup, confirmed working live). Separately, a totally failing provider used to report a false "Translated" success with zero visible error in the popup/bubble; the page translator now tracks consecutive batch failures and surfaces a real "Translation failed" state in the floating bubble instead of silently retrying forever.

## 0.2.2-beta.0

### Patch Changes

- Enter changesets prerelease ("beta") mode. Gen 3's 10-session plan is complete and the codebase is ready for real-world testing before a stable v1 — releases now ship as `X.Y.Z-beta.N` prereleases (auto-detected by the release workflow, which marks the GitHub Release as a prerelease) until this project exits beta with `npx changeset pre exit`.

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- Session 10 (parity audit and launch readiness): compile the ADR index, a full old-repo-vs-Gen-3 feature/provider parity checklist, and an explicit out-of-scope-for-v1 list. Found and documented a real gap via manual verification: content inside an open shadow root on a third-party page is never translated (`collectTextNodes.ts` doesn't descend into shadow roots). No source behavior changed.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- Add release infrastructure: a committed Playwright E2E harness (real Chrome via `--headless=new`, not the extension-less `chrome-headless-shell`), a bundle-size CI guardrail, a finalized CI pipeline order (typecheck → lint → engine-purity → foot-gun guards → tests+coverage → build → bundle-size → E2E → zip), per-browser zip artifact uploads, a Firefox build-validation CI job, and a release workflow triggered by CI's own completion (idempotent, auto-detects prerelease versions) using Changesets for versioning/changelog.
